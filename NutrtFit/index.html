            <h1>Get active and be a <br>healthy weight</h1>
            <p>Staying active is important for keeping a healthy weight and feeling good. Regular exercise, 
                like walking or cycling, helps burn calories, build muscle, and improve energy. Along with exercise, 
                eating a balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains supports weight control. 
                Aiming for about 150 minutes of activity each week is a great goal to start with. 
                By staying consistent with exercise and healthy eating, you can improve your overall health and prevent many diseases.</p>

                <p>Over time, we expanded our services to include a wide range of diet plans, nutrition tips, and fitness programs.

            <h3>Diet Plan</h3>
            <p>For different weight categories, here’s a simple guide: <b>Underweight</b> people should eat more
                 high-calorie foods and lift weights to build muscle. <b>Normal weight</b> individuals should stick to 
                 a balanced diet and exercise regularly. <b>Overweight</b> and <b>obese</b> 
                people should cut calories, eat healthier, and exercise more, with the plan 
                becoming more specific as their weight increases.</p>
